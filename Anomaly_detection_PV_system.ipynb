    "In this project an anomaly detection model based on Isolation forest is trained and evaluated on real data from photovoltaic systems. Such tool might be used to set alarms to a decision-maker when an anomaly is found. The data two PV systems (ID-34 and ID-1276) is used. They have same location and different installed power. Data for system 34 is used for tuning, training and testing and all data for system 1276 is used only for testing.\n",
    "In section 1 a research on the types of failures in such systems and the maintenance strategies is made. The types of anomalies and a brief theoretical explanation about the Isolation forest work mechanism are also included. \n",

    "The data is preprocessed in three steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Imputation of missing data\n",
    "Based on the use case in a real life scenario the model should work with streaming data. The imputation of missing data is happening at the moment when a record comes and the next is not available. Also imputing a missing record with a value such as mean, median or the last available can mask a problem, such as defective sensor. Because of those reasons all missing values are filled with 0. In cases where 0 is normal value, for example `inverter_error_code` missing data is set to -999.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Encoding \n",
    "The `inverter_error_code` feature consists of errors(number different than 0) and 0 standing for normal operation. That information can be used as labeled data and the problem to be treated as supervised. Although the errors appeared in the data are only three. Model trained only with those labels will fail to recognize other types of inverter errors. Because of that for solving the problem unsupervised method is used and the inverter error codes are part of the labeling process for evaluation of the model. In this case the information for different type of error is not valuable and the feature is converted to categorical, where 1 means 'no error' and -1 - 'error occurred'. The total amount of errors in the data is around 2.2%. \n",
    "\n",
    "`wind_direction`, `wind_speed` and `relative_humidity` are features that don't have significant impact on the energy production of a solar panel. The wind direction can have any value between 0 and 360 which is a normal. Same can be applied to relative humidity, any value between 0 and 100 is acceptable. Of course some values are more expected than others. This might lead the model to mistakenly detecting them as anomalies. Although the exact values of those features might cause increased amount of false positives, there absence is abnormal. Because of that only the presence of data from the sensor will be fed to the model. Three new features are extracted - `wind_direction_record_available`, `wind_speed_record_available`, `relative_humidity_record_available` with values 0 or 1, where 0 is no record available and 1 is record available.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Temperature difference feature\n",
    "Negative values of module's temperature are typical mostly at winter nights, which make them easier to be mistaken for anomalies.The module temperature is related to the ambient temperature and the irradiance. In order to capture this relation the module temperature is expressed as difference between the module and the ambient temperature. A negative value is associated with panel being colder than the surroundings, and the positive - hotter. \n",
    "Same feature is extracted for the inverter temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three steps are part of `preprocessing_pipeline`."
