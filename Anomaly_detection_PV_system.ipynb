    "In this project an anomaly detection model based on Isolation forest is trained and evaluated on real data from photovoltaic systems. Such tool might be used to set alarms to a decision-maker when an anomaly is found. The data two PV systems (ID-34 and ID-1276) is used. They have same location and different installed power. Data for system 34 is used for tuning, training and testing and all data for system 1276 is used only for testing.\n",
    "In section 1 a research on the types of failures in such systems and the maintenance strategies is made. The types of anomalies and a brief theoretical explanation about the Isolation forest work mechanism are also included. \n",
